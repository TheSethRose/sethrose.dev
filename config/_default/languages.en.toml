bio = "When I'm not battling corporate inefficiencies or integrating systems that were never meant to talk to each other, you'll catch me on ùïè (Twitter), discussing the latest advancements in AI & machine learning, and their potential to revolutionize industries. I'm always sharpening my skills in full stack development or #buildinpublic - because why not add a few more programming languages to the mix? My secret weapons are my ADHD-fueled brain, a steady stream of caffeine, and an undying love for solving problems that make mere mortals cry."
